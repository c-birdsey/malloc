known bugs: 
    -having issues with ls -l: when running and examining in gdb, at some point when searching for an empty block in malloc, 
    cur->next points to a low mem address outside the heap (e.g. in my tests is was 0x100000002) and this memory was not 
    accessible. thus when the while loop started again, to access the struct with cur->size was causing a segfault. I cannot
    tell where that memory address is coming from. cur-> next should either be NULL or filled with a new block address obtained
    from sbrk
